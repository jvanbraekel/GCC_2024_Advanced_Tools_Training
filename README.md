## Introduction

Sylph is a program designed for ultrafast ANI querying and metagenomic profiling of metagenomic shotgun samples, commonly used in metagenomic sequencing. To provide users with easy access to this advanced methodology, Sylph has recently been wrapped and integrated into Galaxy.

This repository includes several directories that document the development stages of the Sylph tool wrapping process. These directories highlight the addition of advanced tool wrapping concepts, which will be explored in our Advanced Tool Training.

Below, you will find additional information about this project and instructions on how to run it locally.
